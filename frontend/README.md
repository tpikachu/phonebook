# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

You will need yarn version 1.22 to run it. If you'd rather not deal with installing yarn, and you're familiar with running npm instead, feel free to use that. If you do, remove the yarn.lock file and commit the generated package-lock.json file from running `npm install` instead.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn`

This will install all the dependencies.

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

## Usage

This repository is meant to be forked for a frontend coding challenge. Instructions are shared separately with the candidate. It will connect with a uniquely provided backend. There are custom hooks built on react-query available in the api directory to fetch and modify the data. App.tsx has commented examples of how they can be used.
